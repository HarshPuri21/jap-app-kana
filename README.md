# Nihongo Trainer (Flutter / Android) — v1.3

A complete Flutter rewrite of the NihongoTrainer desktop app — 320
sentences, 536 kanji, 533 vocabulary words, and now 280 radicals too, as a
touch-first mobile app with swipe gestures and a customizable background
(your own photo, like a chat wallpaper).

**👉 Start here: [`SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](./SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)** — it
covers two ways to get from this code to an installed app:

- **Option A (recommended):** upload this folder to a free GitHub repo
  and a included automation (GitHub Actions) builds the APK for you in
  the cloud — no installs on your computer at all.
- **Option B:** build it locally with the Flutter SDK, useful if you want
  to tinker with live-reload.

## Quick summary

- All app code and data are already here and finished.
- Either build path takes about 10–30 minutes, mostly waiting, not typing.
- You end up with a real `app-release.apk` you install like any other app,
  and can rebuild any time.

## What's new in 1.3: Radical Trainer

Two new home-screen entries, built from a 280-radical database (the
traditional 214 Kangxi radicals plus 72 additional common/variant
components):

- **Radicals** — browse all 280, or search by name or meaning as you
  type. Tap one for its full meaning, its name/reading(s), how it's
  typically used (e.g. "usually a left-side component"), and every
  example kanji it appears in.
- **Radical Quiz** — the same browse-and-answer format as Learn Kanji:
  see a radical, pick its meaning from 4 options, difficulty filter chips,
  swipe to skip.
- **Test and Mixed** now include a Radicals option, and Mixed draws from
  all four content types together.
- Same click sounds, wrong-answer sound + vibration, and menu-music
  stop/resume behavior as every other lesson screen — nothing new to
  learn about how it behaves.
- Radicals aren't part of Daily Review's spaced repetition (yet) — this
  update is scoped to browsing + quizzing, as asked.

## What's in 1.2: sound, vibration, and a Sound settings section

- **Menu music** loops on the home screen, Settings, and the Take-a-Test
  setup screen, stops the instant you enter a lesson/test/review/
  flashcard screen, and restarts from the beginning when you come back or
  reopen the app. Controlled from Settings: on/off toggle, volume slider
  (default 25%).
- **Click sounds**: one sound for menu/settings taps, a different one for
  taps inside lessons/tests/flashcards/review.
- **Wrong answers** now play an error sound plus a short vibration.
- The Settings screen's "About the app icon" info text has been removed
  (it was just cluttering the screen) — the custom launcher icon itself
  is unchanged and still set up the same way as before.

## What's in 1.1: Daily Review (spaced repetition)

Every vocab word and kanji tracks its own learning progress on-device (no
account, no server). Rate each review **Again / Hard / Good / Easy** and
the app schedules when it should come back — missed items sooner,
well-known ones much later. The home screen's top banner always shows
what's due today and is the fastest way into a review session; Flashcards
mode feeds the same progress too (swipe up = Good, swipe down = Again),
so nothing you do in the app is thrown away when you leave a screen or
switch filters. Existing modes (Learn Sentences, Learn Kanji, Test) are
unchanged.
